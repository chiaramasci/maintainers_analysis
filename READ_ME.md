# Maintainers' validation

## Getting started with Docker

In order to continue, you have to install Docker on your computer.
Can be helpful reading a bit about how Docker works and its basic concepts

Install Docker: docs.docker.com/install/
Docker concepts: docs.docker.com/get-started/

## Running the software

After you have Docker installed, download this project and, on the commandline you enter inside the folder project

To download and enter in the project

    git clone https://github.com/chiaramasci/maintainers_analysis.git
    cd maintainers_analysis

Afterwards, you can run the software with this command:

    docker-compose up

You will have to wait few minutes for the completion of the downloads and the starting up of the software.
The first time you run it will take longer due to some required downloads, but the next time it will not.

Afterwards, in the browser:

    sharing.localhost

to see the online cloud and

    bitz_access.localhost

to have access to the website managing the bitz API (not implemented for these tasks)
