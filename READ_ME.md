# Maintainers' validation

## Getting started with Docker

In order to continue, you have to install Docker on your computer.
Can be helpful reading a bit about how Docker works and its basic concepts

Install Docker: docs.docker.com/install/
Docker concepts: docs.docker.com/get-started/

## Running the software

After you have Docker installed, download this project and, on the commandline you enter inside the folder project

To download and enter in the project

    git clone https://github.com/chiaramasci/maintainers_analysis.git
    cd maintainers_analysis

Afterwards, you can run the software with this command:

    docker-compose up

You will have to wait few minutes for the completion of the downloads and the starting up of the software.
The first time you run it will take longer due to some required downloads, but the next time it will not.

Afterwards, in the browser:

    sharing.localhost

to see the online cloud and

    bitz_access.localhost

to have access to the website managing the bitz API (not implemented for these tasks)

## The tasks

The following tasks can be completed also in more days and each one separately.
In case there are issues at running the software, do not hesitate to contact me directly.

### Zero task: install Docker and answer the first survey

The first task, if you have not done it already, is to install Docker and get the software running.
To do so, follow the paragraphs "Getting started with Docker" and "Running the software".

Important is to then reply to the following surveys (about 15 questions each).
The aim of the first survey is to know which tools are commonly available to the maintainers and the way to receive new information they are more comfortable with.
The aim of the second one is to evaluate the outcome of the installation and the running of the software.
Remember: is the software that is being evaluated, not you. Feel free to make mistakes, not being able to complete the tasks and having doubts... This means not that you are not able to accomplish it, but that the software and its documentation is not designed to allow you to do it. :)
